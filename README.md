# Data Analysis for 2024 USRA Project: What accounts for the relationship between disgust and religiosity?

This repository contains all of the data and code to reproduce our analysis for Benjamin Zubaly, Dr. Jamie Palmer-Hague, and Dr. Kelly Arbeau's 2024 USRA project.

The master analysis document is in the root directory as `2024_USRA_analysis.qmd`. It is a Quarto document that walks through each step of the analysis, providing code, output, and narrative description throughout. Where appropriate, it calls scripts from the `code` directory, which is where any other scripts involved in the analysis are stored. This document has also been rendered into `.html`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` formats in the `docs` directory for convenience.

If you would like to re-render this document (and have quarto installed) you can run `quarto render 2024_USRA_analysis.qmd --to all --output-dir docs` in the terminal (with your working directory at the root).

If you would like to walk through the analysis step by step you can run each chunk in the quarto document.
